I am a spatial ecologist and conservation scientist with a broad interest in the ecological processes that drive the distribution and abundance of animal populations in space and time. As a mix between a field biologist and a data geek, I am an avid [R](https://www.r-project.org/) user, who enjoys working with large datasets (both researcher-collected and citizen science) while developing and/or implementing new statistical methods to answer pressing questions in spatial ecology and conservation. 

My interest spans between biogeography, population ecology, genetics and conservation biology. I am particularly interested in analyzing how individual, population and species respond to global change (climate and land-use) across several spatial and temporal scales. My final goal is to advance into a more reliable predictive ecology and, as a consequence, provide critical knowledge to support better biodiversity conservation .

Much of my work has focused on the ecology and conservation of migratory birds, where I link field surveys, ring-recovery data, and niche modelling techniques to understand the ecology and range dynamics of the species throughout the year. 

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in the [The Biodiversity Modelling Lab](https://damariszurell.github.io/) in Potsdam, Germany, where I am working on understanding how life history and environment shape dispersal in birds.
