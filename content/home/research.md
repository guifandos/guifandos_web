In my research, I combine different types of data and methodological approaches to build a more
integrative ecological science that can 
* Delineate the processes that rule biodiversity responses
to environment changes at or across different spatial and temporal scales. If we better understand
why species are where they are, we can enhance predictions of how this will change into the future
and contribute to solutions for the grand environmental challenges of our time. 
* Identify biases and gaps in existing biodiversity information. I have been working on how information on biodiversity is distributed over space and time, and how we can overcome these information gaps with modelling approaches
