My interest spans between biogeography, population ecology, genetics and conservation biology. I am particularly interested in analyzing how individual, population and species respond to global change (climate and land-use) across several spatial and temporal scales. My final goal is to advance into a more reliable predictive ecology and, as a consequence, provide critical knowledge to support better biodiversity conservation .
