Using individual marking , and an array of state-of-the-art methodologies such as camera traps , GPS trackers, stable isotopes or molecular sequencing, we can monitor species behaviour, movements and abundance. This is essential to fill knowledge gaps on how species distribute in space and the importance of life-history traits, therefore gathering fundamental information to increase our understanding of species response to global environmental change.
