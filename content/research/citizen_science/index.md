Global biodiversity is declining rapidly, largely as a result of human activities. Effective policy and
adaptive management strategies in the face of global change require well-designed biodiversity
monitoring as well as the anticipation of future changes. However, efficient and robust monitoring
schemes are costly to maintain over large areas and many years. In contrast, citizen science data
is being generated at an unprecedented rate. However, opportunistic citizen science data comes
with huge challenges and caveats. These data are characterised by having neither a consistent
structure nor a fixed sampling protocol leading to significant spatial and temporal biases and,
therefore, require careful consideration in ecological modelling and conservation research. My
general interest is the development and application of quantitative tools to answer ecological
questions and address conservation problems.
