abstract: This paper studies the factors affecting passerine (Order Passeriformes)
  species richness in the Western Maghreb, a region at the southwestern border of
  the Palearctic reputed as a primary wintering ground for many common European birds.
  The effect of productivity, temperature, landscape structure and geographical location
  on bird richness was explored at 220 localities across Morocco. The models resulting
  from multivariate analyses supported the effects of productivity, temperature and
  landscape cover on bird richness, with higher numbers of species occurring in warm
  farmlands of the northwest. The most suitable areas for birds avoided the cold and
  arid expanses of the Atlas Mountains and the Sahara and overlapped with the most
  human-impacted sectors. Within these areas, we detected an interspersed distribution
  of sectors of high bird richness and low human incidence. These sectors can be used
  as priority targets for conservation programmes of common birds during the winter.
