abstract: Seasonal animal migration is a widespread phenomenon. At the species level,
  it has been shown that many migratory animal species track similar climatic conditions
  throughout the year. However, it remains unclear whether such a niche tracking pattern
  is a direct consequence of individual behaviour or emerges at the population or
  species level through behavioural variability. Here, we estimated seasonal niche
  overlap and seasonal niche tracking at the individual and population level of central
  European white storks (Ciconia ciconia). We quantified niche tracking for both weather
  and climate conditions to control for the different spatio-temporal scales over
  which ecological processes may operate. Our results indicate that niche tracking
  is a bottom-up process. Individuals mainly track weather conditions while climatic
  niche tracking mainly emerges at the population level. This result may be partially
  explained by a high degree of intra- and inter-individual variation in niche overlap
  between seasons. Understanding how migratory individuals, populations and species
  respond to seasonal environments is key for anticipating the impacts of global environmental
  changes.
