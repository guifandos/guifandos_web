abstract: Predictions of species' current and future ranges are needed to effectively
  manage species under environmental change. Species ranges are typically estimated
  using correlative species distribution models (SDMs), which have been criticized
  for their static nature. In contrast, dynamic occupancy models (DOMs) explicitily
  describe temporal changes in species’ occupancy via colonization and local extinction
  probabilities, estimated from time series of occurrence data. Yet, tests of whether
  these models improve predictive accuracy under current or future conditions are
  rare. Using a long-term data set on 69 Swiss birds, we tested whether DOMs improve
  the predictions of distribution changes over time compared to SDMs. We evaluated
  the accuracy of spatial predictions and their ability to detect population trends.
  We also explored how predictions differed when we accounted for imperfect detection
  and parameterized models using calibration data sets of different time series lengths.
  All model types had high spatial predictive performance when assessed across all
  sites (mean AUC textgreater 0.8), with flexible machine learning SDM algorithms
  outperforming parametric static and DOMs. However, none of the models performed
  well at identifying sites where range changes are likely to occur. In terms of estimating
  population trends, DOMs performed best, particularly for species with strong population
  changes and when fit with sufficient data, while static SDMs performed very poorly.
  Overall, our study highlights the importance of considering what aspects of performance
  matter most when selecting a modelling method for a particular application and the
  need for further research to improve model utility. While DOMs show promise for
  capturing range dynamics and inferring population trends when fitted with sufficient
  data, computational constraints on variable selection and model fitting can lead
  to reduced spatial accuracy of predictions, an area warranting more attention.
