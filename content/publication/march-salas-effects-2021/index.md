abstract: It is widely accepted that changes in the environment affect mean trait
  expression, but little is known about how the environment shapes intra-individual
  and intra-population variance. Theory suggests that intra-individual variance might
  be plastic and under natural selection, rather than reflecting developmental noise,
  but evidence for this hypothesis is scarce. Here, we experimentally tested whether
  differences in intrinsic environmental predictability affect intra-individual and
  intra-population variability of different reproductive traits, and whether intra-individual
  variability is under selection.Under field conditions, we subjected Onobrychis viciifolia
  to more and less predictable precipitation over 4 generations and 4 years. We analysed
  effects on the coefficient of intra-individual variation (CVi-i) and the coefficient
  of intra-population variation (CVi-p), assessed whether the coefficients of intra-individual
  variation (CsVi-i) are under natural selection and tested for transgenerational
  responses (ancestor environmental effects on offspring).Less predictable precipitation
  led to higher CsVi-i and CsVi-p, consistent with plastic responses. The CsVi-i of
  all studied traits were under consistent stabilizing selection, and precipitation
  predictability affected the strength of selection and the location of the optimal
  CVi-i of a single trait. All CsVi-i differed from the optimal CVi-i and the maternal
  and offspring CsVi-i were positively correlated, showing that there was scope for
  change. Nevertheless, no consistent transgenerational effects were found in any
  of the three descendant generations, which contrasts with recent studies that detected
  rapid transgenerational responses in the trait means of different plant species.
  This suggests that changes in intra-individual variability take longer to evolve
  than changes in trait means, which may explain why high intra-individual variability
  is maintained, despite the stabilizing selection.The results indicate that plastic
  changes of intra-individual variability are an important determinant of whether
  plants will be able to cope with changes in environmental predictability induced
  by the currently observed climatic change.
