abstract: Species distribution models (SDMs) constitute the most common class of models
  across ecology, evolution and conservation. The advent of ready-to-use software
  packages and increasing availability of digital geoinformation have considerably
  assisted the application of SDMs in the past decade, greatly enabling their broader
  use for informing conservation and management, and for quantifying impacts from
  global change. However, models must be fit for purpose, with all important aspects
  of their development and applications properly considered. Despite the widespread
  use of SDMs, standardisation and documentation of modelling protocols remain limited,
  which makes it hard to assess whether development steps are appropriate for end
  use. To address these issues, we propose a standard protocol for reporting SDMs,
  with an emphasis on describing how a study's objective is achieved through a series
  of modeling decisions. We call this the ODMAP (Overview, Data, Model, Assessment
  and Prediction) protocol, as its components reflect the main steps involved in building
  SDMs and other empirically-based biodiversity models. The ODMAP protocol serves
  two main purposes. First, it provides a checklist for authors, detailing key steps
  for model building and analyses, and thus represents a quick guide and generic workflow
  for modern SDMs. Second, it introduces a structured format for documenting and communicating
  the models, ensuring transparency and reproducibility, facilitating peer review
  and expert evaluation of model quality, as well as meta-analyses. We detail all
  elements of ODMAP, and explain how it can be used for different model objectives
  and applications, and how it complements efforts to store associated metadata and
  define modelling standards. We illustrate its utility by revisiting nine previously
  published case studies, and provide an interactive web-based application to facilitate
  its use. We plan to advance ODMAP by encouraging its further refinement and adoption
  by the scientific community.
