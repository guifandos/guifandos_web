abstract: 'The formation of independent evolutionary lineages involves neutral and
  selective factors, and understanding their relative roles in population divergence
  is a fundamental goal of speciation research. Correlations between allele frequencies
  and environmental variability can reveal the role of selection, yet the relative
  contribution of drift can be difficult to establish. Recently diversified taxa like
  the Oregon junco (Aves, Passerellidae, Junco hyemalis oreganus) of western North
  America provide ideal scenarios to apply genetic-environment association analyses
  (GEA) while controlling for population structure. Analysis of genome-wide SNP loci
  revealed marked genetic structure consisting of differentiated populations in isolated,
  dry southern mountain ranges, and less divergent, recently expanded populations
  in humid northern latitudes. We used correlations between genomic and environmental
  variance to test for three specific modes of evolutionary divergence: (a) drift
  in geographic isolation, (b) differentiation along continuous selective gradients
  and (c) isolation by adaptation. We found evidence of strong drift in southern mountains,
  but also signals of local adaptation driven by temperature, precipitation, elevation
  and vegetation, especially when controlling for population history. We identified
  numerous variants under selection scattered across the genome, suggesting that local
  adaptation can promote rapid differentiation when acting over multiple independent
  loci.'
