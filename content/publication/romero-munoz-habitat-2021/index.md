abstract: "Global biodiversity is under high and rising anthropogenic pressure. Yet,\
  \ how the taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional facets of biodiversity are affected\
  \ by different threats over time is unclear. This is particularly true for the two\
  \ main drivers of the current biodiversity crisis: habitat destruction and overexploitation.\
  \ We provide the first long-term assessment of multifaceted biodiversity changes\
  \ caused by these threats for any tropical region. Focussing on larger mammals in\
  \ South America's 1.1 million km2 Gran Chaco region, we assessed changes in multiple\
  \ biodiversity facets between 1985 and 2015, determined which threats drive those\
  \ changes, and identified remaining key areas for all biodiversity facets. Using\
  \ habitat and threat maps, we found, first, that between 1985 and 2015 taxonomic\
  \ (TD), phylogenetic (PD) and functional (FD) diversity all declined drastically\
  \ across over half of the area assessed. FD declined about 50% faster than TD and\
  \ PD, and these declines were mainly driven by species loss, rather than species\
  \ turnover. Second, habitat destruction, hunting, and both threats together contributed\
  \ 57%, 37%, and 6% to overall facet declines, respectively. However, hunting pressure\
  \ increased where TD and PD declined most strongly, whereas habitat destruction\
  \ disproportionally contributed to FD declines. Third, just 23% of the Chaco would\
  \ have to be protected to safeguard the top 17% of all three facets. Our findings\
  \ uncover a widespread impoverishment of mammal species richness, evolutionary history,\
  \ and ecological functions across broad areas of the Chaco due to increasing habitat\
  \ destruction and hunting. Moreover, our results pinpoint key areas that should\
  \ be preserved and managed to maintain all facets of mammalian diversity across\
  \ the Chaco. More generally, our work highlights how long-term changes in biodiversity\
  \ facets can be assessed and attributed to specific threats, to better understand\
  \ human impacts on biodiversity and to guide conservation planning to mitigate them."
