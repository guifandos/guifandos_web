abstract: Populations at the far edges of their ranges tend to be scarce, and they
  are frequently of conservation concern. This paper examines the distribution of
  three raptors (Circaetus gallicus, Hieraaetus pennatus and Milvus migrans) at the
  southwestern boundary of their breeding range. We modelled species distribution
  to obtain habitat suitability indexes that were validated with extensive fieldwork
  in Morocco and Spain. Our results support a strong effect of habitat suitability
  and a bottleneck effect of the Strait of Gibraltar on raptor distribution. However,
  after controlling for these effects, the three species were scarcer in Morocco than
  in Spain. We did not find differences between the two countries in the number of
  power lines that are dangerous to raptors or in general impacts of agricultural
  intensification on bird populations (we assessed more farmland birds in Morocco).
  However, many more people (i.e., shepherds) were detected in Morocco, whose negative
  effect on raptors could explain the depletion of their populations. These transboundary
  differences are used to discuss the fate of these peripheral populations in a context
  of climate change and rural abandonment. They also highlight the need for strengthening
  raptor conservation around the Strait of Gibraltar, where a permanent flow of raptors
  converges throughout the year.
