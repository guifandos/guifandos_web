abstract: Space use by animals is determined by the interplay between movement and
  the environment, and is thus mediated by habitat selection, biotic interactions
  and intrinsic factors of moving individuals. These processes ultimately determine
  home range size, but their relative contributions and dynamic nature remain less
  explored. We investigated the role of habitat selection, movement unrelated to habitat
  selection and intrinsic factors related to sex in driving space use and home range
  size in Iberian ibex, Capra pyrenaica. We used GPS collars to track ibex across
  the year in two different geographical areas of Sierra Nevada, Spain, and measured
  habitat variables related to forage and roost availability.
