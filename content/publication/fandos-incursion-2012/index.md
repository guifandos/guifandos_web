  domestic carnivores are frequently considered a threat to wildlife inside and around
  urban areas, little is known about the incursions of these animals from urban areas
  to the surrounding habitats. To explore this, we sampled carnivores in wooded areas
  surrounding four villages located in the mountains north of Madrid by using 40 camera-trapping
  stations. They were distributed at regular distances within a perpendicular transect
  distributed from 10 to 2000 m from the urban border. The results suggest that the
  incidence of domestic carnivores (cats and dogs) was constrained to &lt;400 m from
  the urban border, and that the presence of domestic carnivores did not interfere
  with the distribution of wild carnivores (foxes, beech martens, badgers, genets,
  etc.), which show random distribution patterns around villages. This means that
  overpredation at the village edges could mainly be due to the effect of domestic
  animals and not to that of wild carnivores attracted to urban areas.textless/ptextgreatertextless/sectiontextgreater
