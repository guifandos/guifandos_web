abstract: Migratory birds spend periods of the year in different locations as a response
  to seasonal changes in environmental suitability. They are classified as either
  ‘niche-trackers’ or ‘niche-switchers’, depending on whether they track or switch
  environmental conditions throughout the year. However, the relationship between
  these strategies and their migratory behaviour is still unclear. Here we examine
  whether migratory European Robins Erithacus rubecula and Eurasian Blackcaps Sylvia
  atricapilla track environmental conditions between breeding and wintering areas
  and whether their behaviour differs from that of their sedentary counterparts. We
  used ringing data for both migratory and sedentary individuals wintering sympatrically
  in the Iberian Peninsula to assess the environmental conditions relating to their
  seasonal distributions. We explored seasonal niche-tracking using two multivariate
  analyses with alternative sets of predictor variables (landscape and climate) to
  generate different environmental scenarios. Our results show that migratory individuals
  track similar climatic conditions throughout their seasonal distributions, whereas
  sedentary birds cope with great variation in climate over the course of the year.
  In addition, migratory birds show less seasonal overlap in the landscape structure
  of their chosen habitats compared with sedentary individuals. These results suggest
  that there is a trade-off between, on the one hand, the cost for migrants of travelling
  long distances and, on the other, the increased flexibility required by sedentary
  birds if they are to tolerate a wider suite of environmental conditions within their
  permanent ranges. Given that sedentary populations in the southern Iberian Peninsula
  seem to be linked to populations of migratory individuals of these two species that
  started to move northwards after the last glacial cycle, the observed patterns suggest
  that migrant birds represent a fraction of the southern population that is specialized
  in the exploitation of a narrower range of environmental conditions.
