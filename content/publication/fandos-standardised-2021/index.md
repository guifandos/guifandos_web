abstract: Dispersal is a key life-history trait for most species and essential to
  ensure connectivity and gene flow between populations and facilitate population
  viability in variable environments. Despite the increasing importance of range shifts
  due to global change, dispersal has proved difficult to quantify, limiting empirical
  understanding of this phenotypic trait and wider synthesis.Here we aim to estimate
  and compare empirical dispersal kernels for European breeding birds considering
  average dispersal, natal (before first breeding) and breeding dispersal (between
  subsequent breeding attempts), and test whether different dispersal properties are
  phylogenetically conserved.We standardised and analysed data from an extensive volunteer-based
  bird ring-recoveries database in Europe (EURING) by accounting for biases related
  to different censoring thresholds in reporting between countries and to migratory
  movements. Then, we fitted four widely used probability density functions in a Bayesian
  framework to compare and provide the best statistical descriptions of the average,
  the natal and the breeding dispersal kernels for each bird species.The dispersal
  movements of the 234 European bird species analysed were statistically best explained
  by heavy-tailed kernels, meaning that while most individuals disperse over short
  distances, long-distance dispersal is a feature in almost all bird species. The
  overall phylogenetic signal in both median and long dispersal distances was low
  (Pagel’s λ textless 0.40), implying a high degree of taxonomic generality in our
  findings. As expected in birds, natal dispersal was 5 Km greater as an average than
  breeding dispersal for most species (88% species analysed).Our comprehensive analysis
  of empirical kernels indicates that long-distance dispersal is common among European
  breeding bird species and across life stages. The dispersal estimates offer a first
  guide to selecting appropriate dispersal kernels in range expansion studies and
  provide new avenues to improve our understanding of the mechanisms and rules underlying
  dispersal events.
