abstract: We studied the effect of climate change on the distribution of two insectivorous
  passerines (the meadow pipit Anthus pratensis and the chiffchaff Phylloscopus collybita)
  in wintering grounds of the Western Mediterranean basin. In this region, precipitation
  and temperature can affect the distribution of these birds through direct (thermoregulation
  costs) or indirect effects (primary productivity). Thus, it can be postulated that
  projected climate changes in the region will affect the extent and suitability of
  their wintering grounds. We studied pipit and chiffchaff abundance in several hundred
  localities along a belt crossing Spain and Morocco and assessed the effects of climate
  and other geographical and habitat predictors on bird distribution. Multivariate
  analyses reported a positive effect of temperature on the present distribution of
  the two species, with an additional effect of precipitation on the meadow pipit.
  These climate variables were used with Maxent to model the occurrence probabilities
  of species using ring recoveries as presence data. Abundance and occupancy of the
  two species in the study localities adjusted to the distribution models, with more
  birds in sectors of high climate suitability. After validation, these models were
  used to forecast the distribution of climate suitability according to climate projections
  for 2050–2070 (temperature increase and precipitation reduction). Results show an
  expansion of climatically suitable sectors into the highlands by the effect of warming
  on the two species, and a retreat of the meadow pipit from southern sectors related
  to rain reduction. The predicted patterns show a mean increase in climate suitability
  for the two species due to the warming of the large highland expanses typical of
  the western Mediterranean.
