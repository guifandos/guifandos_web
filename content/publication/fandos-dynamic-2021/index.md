abstract: 'Effective conservation of animal populations depends on the availability
  of reliable data derived from rigorous monitoring protocols, which allows us to
  assess trends and understand the processes they are governed by. Nevertheless, population
  monitoring schemes are hampered by multiple sources of errors resulting from specific
  logistical and survey constraints. Two common complications are the non-visitation
  of some sites in certain years and preferential sampling (PS), that is, the tendency
  to survey “better” sites disproportionately more often. Both factors can lead to
  serious biases unless accommodated into models. We used 22 yr of nest-monitoring
  data to develop a dynamic multistate occupancy model, including a PS component to
  investigate occupancy and reproduction dynamics in a peripheral Black Stork (Ciconia
  nigra) population in Spain. We analyzed the effects of climate and nesting substrate
  (tree vs. cliff) on population dynamics and accounted for PS and non-visitation
  biases using a model that distinguished three territorial states: unoccupied, occupied
  without, or occupied with successful reproduction. We found strong evidence for
  positive PS, and when accounting for this bias, lower population size estimates
  were generated. Black stork nests had a high probability of remaining in the same
  state from one year to the next, with successful nests more likely to be occupied
  again and to be successful the following year than occupied but unsuccessful or
  unoccupied nests. Nesting substrate and spring precipitation did not influence state
  transition probabilities or the probability of reproductive success; nevertheless,
  cliff nest occupancy was overall higher than tree nest occupancy. Our results highlight
  the importance of correcting for non-visitation and PS in habitat occupancy models.
  If these potential biasing effects are not accounted for, inferences of population
  size may be overestimate. Multistate occupancy models with correction for PS offer
  a powerful analytical framework for data collected as part of population studies
  of unmarked animals. These models compensate for common methodological biases in
  biological surveys and can help implement efficient conservation strategies based
  on robust population dynamics estimates.'
