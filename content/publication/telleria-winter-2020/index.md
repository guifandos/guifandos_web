abstract: 'This paper explores how environmental traits shape the winter distribution
  of passerine (O. Passeriformes) richness in the south-western Palearctic, a major
  wintering ground for the European avifauna. We apply three complementary approaches.
  First, we assess the way climate, landscape and habitat affect species richness
  by means of field counts across the study area. Second, we model the spatial distribution
  of six common passerines using ring recoveries as presence data. Finally, where
  the resulting models predict the actual distribution of birds, we employ the models
  to forecast the future distribution of richness according to predictions of climate
  change, i.e. of increasing temperature and decreasing precipitation. The results
  support an effect of landscape, habitat structure, temperature and precipitation
  on bird richness. Distribution models fit the actual distribution of bird richness
  and their predictions suggest that winter species richness will decrease in lowlands
  and increase in highlands. This pattern could be related to direct effects of temperature
  on thermoregulatory costs and indirect effects on winter primary productivity affecting
  food resources. These results also indicate that, in a context of climate warming,
  species-rich sectors will shift from lowlands to highlands, suggesting that uplands
  will have a regulatory role in the future winter distribution of birds.—Tellería,
