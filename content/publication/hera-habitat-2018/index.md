abstract: Mediterranean woodlands and associated shrub formations of southern Iberia
  are key habitats for conservation of migratory birds. In some bird species, migratory
  and sedentary conspecifics meet in these areas during winter, but our understanding
  of how each population group is distributed over available habitats and the factors
  that determine their spatial organization are still unclear. This seriously limits
  our ability to assess their vulnerability to ongoing environmental changes affecting
  wintering habitats in this region. We used hydrogen isotopic signatures of feathers
  (δDf) to shed light on the habitat distribution of seasonally sympatric European
  Robin Erithacus rubecula populations wintering in Campo de Gibraltar that are currently
  facing a drastic decline. In contrast to previous studies that used morphological
  methods to distinguish the migratory behaviour of wintering Robins in this area,
  our isotopic approach revealed that sedentary Robins were not outcompeted upon the
  arrival of migrants and remained in the woodlands where they reproduce, which agrees
  with results obtained in other regions. Interestingly, we also found that migratory
  Robins with a closer breeding origin (higher δDf values) had a higher probability
  of occupying woodlands than did migrants coming from further away. Overall, our
  results suggest that the role of breeding origin in shaping the distribution of
  Robins during winter in Campo de Gibraltar is more relevant than the effects of
  sex, age or body size, which might facilitate the evolution of local adaptations
  for the exploitation of each habitat type.
