abstract: Morphological methods to distinguish between avian groups of research interest
  (e.g. different sexes, populations or cryptic species) need to be externally validated
  to ensure reliable performance across situations. In this study, we used stable
  hydrogen isotope ratios of feathers (δ2Hf) to test the validity of morphological
  classification functions (MCFs) previously designed to assess the migratory behaviour
  of European Robins Erithacus rubecula wintering in southern Iberia. Our results
  show that a great number of migrants (mostly females and juveniles) were erroneously
  assigned as sedentary, which could compromise the reliability of previous ecological
  studies that made use of these MCFs. The development of improved MCFs or the use
  of alternative differentiation methods (δ2Hf) could help us to gain a more realistic
  insight into the habitat distribution and ecological interactions of sympatric migratory
  and sedentary robins overwintering in southern Iberia.
