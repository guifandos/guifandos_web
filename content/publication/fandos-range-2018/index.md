abstract: Because migrant birds occur in different parts of the world in different
  seasons, their numbers may be limited by the size of the smallest area they inhabit
  during the year. In addition, restricted ranges make populations more susceptible
  to local perturbations such that range size is frequently considered a correlate
  of species vulnerability. Despite this, little is known about the balance between
  seasonal ranges in the migrant populations of partially migratory species. These
  migrants are difficult to segregate from sedentary conspecifics in winter grounds
  and thus the extent of their ranges is difficult to assess. Here, we studied the
  extent of potential breeding and wintering ranges of 10 partial migratory passerines
  moving to winter in the Iberian Peninsula and the Maghreb. After testing migratory
  connectivity of the individual species, we used niche modelling to calculate the
  extent of potential breeding and wintering ranges in 1,113 pairs of ring recoveries
  linking individuals between breeding and wintering localities. The results indicate
  that most species show migratory connectivity and that all of them show range compression
  in winter relative to the breeding range, with scores ranging between 19% and 58%
  (mean 37%) of breeding ranges. We discuss the importance of non-breeding grounds
  for conserving migratory passerines in the Western Mediterranean Basin, an area
  under pressure from climate change and agricultural intensification.
