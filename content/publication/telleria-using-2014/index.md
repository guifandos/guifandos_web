abstract: Capsule Ring records can be used to predict spatial changes in habitat suitability
  in wintering grounds of migratory birds as shown by a case study with the Meadow
  Pipit (Anthus pratensis).Aims To forecast the winter distribution of the Meadow
  Pipit in the Iberian Peninsula and the Maghreb (1 700 000 km2) by combining ring
  records and fields surveys.Methods We processed winter ring records with Maxent,
  a popular machine-learning technique used to predict the occurrence probability
  of species. We then tested whether the occurrence probabilities predicted by the
  model were significantly positively related to the actual abundance of the Pipit
  in Spain and Morocco.Results Occurrence probabilities provided by Maxent explained
  6% of Pipit abundance distribution in partial least squares regression analyses.
  There was, in addition, a weak effect of geographical location (1.5%) and a strong
  effect of local vegetation (17.6%) on Pipit distribution. The occurrence probabilities
  were used to classify the winter range of the Meadow Pipit in sectors of high, medium
  and low suitability. The most suitable sector occupied 9% of the region (153 000
  km2) and was restricted to warm and moist lowlands where Pipits gather in grasslands.Conclusion
  These results support the potential usefulness of cartographic models derived from
  ring records to describe the wintering range of migratory birds.
