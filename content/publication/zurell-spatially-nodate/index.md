abstract: Models are useful tools for understanding and predicting ecological patterns
  and processes. Under ongoing climate and biodiversity change, they can greatly facilitate
  decision-making in conservation and restoration and help designing adequate management
  strategies for an uncertain future. Here, we review the use of spatially explicit
  models for decision support and to identify key gaps in current modelling in conservation
  and restoration. Of 650 reviewed publications, 217 publications had a clear management
  application and were included in our quantitative analyses. Overall, modelling studies
  were biased towards static models (79%), towards the species and population level
  (80%) and towards conservation (rather than restoration) applications (71%). Correlative
  niche models were the most widely used model type. Dynamic models as well as the
  gene-to-individual level and the community-to-ecosystem level were underrepresented,
  and explicit cost optimisation approaches were only used in 10% of the studies.
  We present a new model typology for selecting models for animal conservation and
  restoration, characterising model types according to organisational levels, biological
  processes of interest and desired management applications. This typology will help
  to more closely link models to management goals. Additionally, future efforts need
  to overcome important challenges related to data integration, model integration
  and decision-making. We conclude with five key recommendations, suggesting that
  wider usage of spatially explicit models for decision support can be achieved by
  1) developing a toolbox with multiple, easier-to-use methods, 2) improving calibration
  and validation of dynamic modelling approaches and 3) developing best-practise guidelines
  for applying these models. Further, more robust decision-making can be achieved
  by 4) combining multiple modelling approaches to assess uncertainty, and 5) placing
  models at the core of adaptive management. These efforts must be accompanied by
  long-term funding for modelling and monitoring, and improved communication between
  research and practise to ensure optimal conservation and restoration outcomes.
