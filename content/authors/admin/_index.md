I am a spatial ecologist and conservation scientist with a broad interest in the ecological processes that drive the distribution and abundance of animal populations in space and time. As a mix between a field biologist and a data geek, I am an avid [R](https://www.r-project.org/) user, who enjoys working with large datasets (both researcher-collected and citizen science) while developing and/or implementing new statistical methods to answer pressing questions in spatial ecology and conservation. 

My interest spans between biogeography, population ecology, genetics and conservation biology. I am particularly interested in analyzing how individual, population and species respond to global change (climate and land-use) across several spatial and temporal scales. My final goal is to advance into a more reliable predictive ecology and, as a consequence, provide critical knowledge to support better biodiversity conservation .

I am currently an Assitant Professor at Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Spain, member of the [Evolution and Conservation Research group](https://www.ucm.es/bcveng/). Currently, I am working on [INCISE]({{< relref "/projects/incise" >}}) project where I integrate structured monitoring data, citizen science data and cutting-edge quantitative modelling tools to improve our understanding of biodiversity dynamics
