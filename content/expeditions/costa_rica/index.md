Biodiversity in the tropics is continually being threatened by anthropogenic disturbances
such as habitat degradation and fragmentation. Unfortunately, conservation decisions and
management of wildlife are difficult tasks to undertake without adequate scientific knowledge.
In the tropics, little is known about the conservation value of secondary forests for mammals, the
manner in which fragmentation can affect low-density populations, how mammalian
assemblages have changed over time, and even some of the most basic ecology of organisms.
Herein, I use multi-species and single-species approaches at different spatial scales to address
these topics using the non-volant mammals in the Caribbean lowland rainforests of Costa Rica. I
first tested the null hypothesis that primary and secondary forests have equivalent assemblages of
non-volant mammals. I found no significant differences in the community composition of nonvolant mammals in these two forest types. This community-based study led me to address the
population biology of the collared peccary, one of the most common species in these faunal
surveys. Using both my data and historical records, I established that this species has been
greatly affected by anthropogenic disturbances in the area, and increased after the extirpation of
white-lipped peccaries. My work at both the community and population level emphasized that
the rodent communities in the Caribbean lowlands are at low densities, as represented by trap
success. Fragmentation of tropical forests may therefore have particular consequences for
mammalian communities. I thus performed a landscape level study with 15 fragments in Costa
Ricaâ€™s Caribbean lowlands. This work revealed that forest fragments showed differences in
species diversity and relative abundance. Larger fragments (>9 km2) had higher relative
abundance for all species. I also focused on the population biology of two species, the spiny
pocket mouse, *Heteromys desmarestianus* and the arboreal vesper mouse, *Nyctomys sumichrasti*.
My work on the former species included molecular genetic studies which revealed that the Caribbean lowlands have cryptic diversity that has not been previously explored. In overview,
non-volant mammalian communities of the Caribbean lowlands represent a rich assemblage of
organisms that are crucial to the health of tropical ecosystems. While anthropogenic
disturbances are affecting these populations, a good understanding of the conservation value of
secondary forests, how fragmentation can affect populations, and the ecology of organisms is
crucial for making data-driven management and conservation decisions.
